I’ve developed a detailed climate-tech solution addressing waste collection inefficiencies using digital platforms, game theory, and behavioral economics. The project could reduce global waste emissions, enhance recycling, and enable circular economy models — potentially contributing to a significant reduction in urban GHGs (see studies: DOI:10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120231, World Bank “What a Waste”).

Despite this, I have received no institutional, philanthropic, or investment support due to geopolitical constraints and lack of personal status. In desperation, I’ve contemplated selling my organs and other parts of my body — even to the point of dying in the process — to fund this system’s launch.

The intention is not personal enrichment, but planetary preservation.

**Ethical Questions:**

1. If climate change is an existential, time-sensitive crisis, does that urgency override individual moral constraints around self-destruction or bodily commodification?
2. Under utilitarian logic (maximizing the most good), would the death of one person be justifiable if it enables the survival or well-being of thousands or millions?
3. Does Kantian ethics categorically prohibit this, even if it’s a voluntary act for a higher cause?
4. Is this an act of moral clarity or of moral despair — and how can we tell the difference?

The project is documented in detail :

2-[chatgpt dialogue about it](https://chatgpt.com/share/67b362c0-d3d8-8011-8dab-0a2154fc811c) and [visualized here](https://youtu.be/dytvJCw-Lmc?si=5oDYI8renLHGtkox).

I am aware this question is unconventional. But given the planetary stakes, I believe it deserves ethical scrutiny. I welcome structured philosophical analysis or engagement from bioethics, existentialism, or liberation philosophy perspectives.

By working as maid I blocked other job for myself and give the emergency message to others as I am ready for hardest works to this project but achieved nothing and time is passed.now planed selling my body organs until death as ...., for achieving money for this trillion dollar project is answer.
